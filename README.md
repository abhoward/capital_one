# capital_one
Script that pulls data from Capital One API and returns monthly income and expenses.

Requires at least Python 2.6 and the installation of three Python packages: `requests`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.
You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Note that this script is not compatible with Python 3.

Once you've installed Python (or if you already have it installed), the simplest way to install the three packages above is by installing Anaconda, a free package and environment manager.
To do this, follow [this](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) link and download the installer according to your operating system.
Once you've installed Anaconda, you should be able to run this script.
